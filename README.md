# Visualization Checklist

In the updated version of the Python code base (v3), I have incorporated 27 different plots and their variations. Additionally, Plot types and options are available in the jupyter notebook. Visualization checklist covers 4 phases - Before the Visualization, Select the Visualization, During the Visualization and After the Visualization.

Note: I have deleted Version 2 to avoid confusion. 

Please feel free to suggest any changes.
