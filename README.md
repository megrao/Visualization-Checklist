# Visualization Checklist

## For Evaluation, please refer - Python code base cheat sheet - Updated version 3 and the checklist in pdf or doc format. 

The intial cheatsheet had all the codes but in the updated version, I have incorporated 27 different plots and their variations. Due to errors, I couldn't include them initially.

Please feel free to suggest any changes. Plot types and options are explained in the coding cheat sheet (updated version 3).
